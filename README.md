# Updation in code
I have changed entire folder structure of PriceComparisonTool_Backend repo for the purpose of deployment on vercel. So, if you wish to clone both frontend and backend codes then use only scrapper.py file of previous backend repo commits to run application on your localhost.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
